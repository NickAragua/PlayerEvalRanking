Usage instructions:

Drag and drop exported registered player list into the bottom right box. This will get you a list of all registered players and their grade levels.
Drag and drop individual coach evals into top right box. You will be able to preview the loaded data there. You may drag and drop multiple coach eval files at the same time.
To load the "player rankings" file from the previous season, drag and drop it over the top left box.

Coalesced player list (top left):
Players highlighted in red have no eval data (coach or otherwise) or have been flagged otherwise
Players highlighted in orange are not currently registered with WYSA

Click 'merge eval' to add the current contents of the top right box to the coalesced player list in the top left box. This is used for "current" season evaluations.
Click 'merge previous season eval' to add the current contents of the top right box to the coalesced player list in the top left box.  This is used for "previous" season evaluations.

If you mess up and want to undo your last "merge", click the "Undo" button.

To start building teams, click "add new team", then start dragging and dropping players from the coalesced list in the top left to the team list in the bottom left.
If you want to move a player off a team or to another team, drag and drop them up to the coalesced list and then back to the other team.

To save your work in progress click 'Save' and pick a destination file. To restore it, click 'Load'. 
'Export' takes your teams and outputs them to an Excel file formatted similarly (but less pretty) to the team roster files that we submit currently.

TODO: Team view for convenient team management

Known issues: importing a coach eval file, merging it then importing another one and merging it will lead to incorrect math in the player eval scores
